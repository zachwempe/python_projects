Hey {0}!! This is Justin! I just wanted to remind you that the SG elections are re-opening TODAY at 8 AM, (so like now lol, they're probably open while you're looking at this) and ends Thursday at 5pm! One of the best ways for you to make a difference on campus is by letting your voice be heard! Knowing me, you can bet that there's mental health initiatives on the platform for the campaign I support, specifically working to incorporate some more flexibility with regards to the effect mental health has on academics. Student Gov is holding a THIRD and FINAL round of elections that's a runoff between Colton and Mehraz and another campaign, but there're several things that set us apart from any other team; primarily, that we're the only ones with mental health and interpersonal violence prevention on our platform. Colton and Mehraz would really appreciate your vote ONE LAST TIME and I know I certainly would!! It takes like 30 seconds and is super quick!!! You can vote at {1} !
What's up {0}? Colton and Mehraz are running for SG president and vice president and need your vote ONE LAST TIME! They want to expand conversations around mental health and help support undocumented students, and would really appreciate your vote! Vote today and tomorrow from 8am-5pm at {1}
Hey {0}! I know this election season has been crazy, but this is finally it! Colton and Mehraz need your vote one last time!! A vote for them means a full week of Thanksgiving break and SURE Walk expansion. Vote today starting at 8am until tomorrow at 5pm at {1}
