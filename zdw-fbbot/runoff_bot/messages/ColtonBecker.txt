Hey {0}! So I know you're probably tired of hearing about this by now, but student wide elections are open again for one last round of voting. Mehraz and I won the initial election and the revote, but because we were 43 votes shy of a majority in the second round (your vote/voice really does count), there's a runoff. If elected, we will address the inadequate legal aid for undocumented students, lack of prayer spaces for Muslim students, poor mental health resources, inaccessibility of healthy food options, and the shortness of Thanksgiving break which limits out of state and international students from traveling home to be with their loved ones for the holiday. One thing in particular about our platform, however, is extremely important, and that's interpersonal violence prevention. Sexual assault, harassment, stalking, and other forms of relationship violence are pervasive at UT. We are the only platform with interpersonal violence prevention, and we have primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention initiatives. This is so important and why we have continued to stay focused, despite the hostility and negativity of the past month. This is the last and most important chance to make your voice heard. Your vote will allow us to support survivors and address interpersonal violence on a scale not seen before at UT. This is our chance as a community to take a stand against sexual assault, and we need your help to make it happen. You can vote now at {1} until tomorrow at 5pm; please let me know if I can answer any questions for you, and thank you so so much for taking the time to read this!
