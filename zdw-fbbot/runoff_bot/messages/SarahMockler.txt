"Hey {0}, you may have heard, but Colton and Mehraz are STILL running for Student Body President and Vice President! This is the last, final, and most important vote! In the last round of voting, we were 43 votes from a majority -- every single vote is vital. I'm crazy about this campaign and it's platform: measures addressing campus sexual violence, excusing class absences due to mental health emergencies (bc mental health IS health!), full week of thanksgiving break, and literally so many more points that benefit everyone across campus. donâ€™t forget to vote (again) at {1} until 5pm Thursday.
