Hi {0}, I know it's tedious voting so many times, but we need to vote one more to make sure that the only campaign with interpersonal violence prevention on the platform gets a chance. It takes three clicks at {1} to make sure we make campus safer. Thank you!
Hey {0}, social media isn't a campaign wasteland on Friday! Until then, you're used to taking 30 seconds at {1} to vote, so help us end election season while getting progressive, tangible change.
Happy Last Election Day, {0} Celebrate the end of the permanent election season with me tomorrow at 8 through Thursday at 5PM at {1}
