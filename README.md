zdw-fbbot:

    - quick and dirty facebook messaging script used to facilitate more efficient
      and faster facebook messaging by members of a Student Government campaign team

    - team members wishing to make use of the script would log in on my laptop from the terminal
      and the script would then use a pre-generated list of their assigned facebook friends
      (generated by assignment.py for the first round, new_assignment.py after that)
      to send as many messages as possible before being blocked by facebook's rate-limiting

zdw-groupme

    - GroupMe bot hosted on Heroku that allowed interfaced with a Google Spreadsheet
      containing a schedule of campaign members who had signed up to table.

    - Bot allowed users to send 'my schedule' in a group in order to get a list of their
      shifts (as far out as had been published by campaign leaders).
      
    - Bot also allowed users to send the name of a shift (e.g. 'Tuesday 11:00-12:00 West Mall')
      and receive a list of campaign workers who were assigned to be tabling at that
      time and location.
